# polar-complex-calculator
This is a small assingment C++ console interface program built to process calculation and conversion involving Polar Coordinates and Complex Numbers. 

## Project Requirements and Objectives
- lllow user to input polar coordinate and show the converted complex number/rectangular coodinate back to the user.
- Allow user to input complex number/rectangular coordinate, and the converted result polar coordinate will be displayed back to the user. 
- Simple arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) should be allowed in the program, user will enter 2 value while the resulted value after artihmetic operation will   be displayed back to the user. 
- Allow user to determine if two polar coordinate are the same, for example the polar coordinates (1, 45°) and (-1,225°) are actually equal.
- Alow user to input a polar coordinate and a complex number, and then determine if they are actually equal or not.
- For Polar coordinate input, the program must also be able to accept the arguments of the polar coordinates in degrees or radian measure.
